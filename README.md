# twitter-clone

This repo was originally created with a very "hacky" sort of mindset, to make a long story short, I only wanted to on it for 2 days. I had a blast working with React Server Components and sprinkling in React Client Components only in the places that needed it. I want to go back and perfect this paradigm as a lot of this code was quickly thrown together. From there, I want to build out more features.
